# Multiple Linear-Regression
## What is Multiple Linear Regression? 
Multiple linear regression refers to a statistical technique that is used to predict the outcome of a variable based on the value of two or more variables. 
It is sometimes known simply as multiple regression, and it is an extension of linear regression. 
The variable that we want to predict is known as the dependent variable, while the variables we use to predict the value of the dependent variable are known as independent or explanatory variables.

# Summary 
Multiple linear regression refers to a **statistical technique** that uses two or more **independent variables** to predict the outcome of a **dependent variable**.
The technique enables analysts to determine the variation of the model and the relative contribution of each independent variable in the total variance.
Multiple regression can take two forms, i.e., **linear regression and non-linear regression**.

Where: 

**yi is the dependent or predicted variable** 
**β0 is the y-intercept, i.e., the value of y when both xi and x2 are 0.** 
**β1 and β2 are the regression coefficients representing the change in y relative to a one-unit change in xi1 and xi2, respectively.** 
**βp is the slope coefficient for each independent variable** 
**ϵ is the model’s random error (residual) term.**
